## General
Everyone knows the game, no description needed.
One day x, at night, bored we decided to create something fun in python to practice a little more with this language and this is the result
<br>

## To play
To test this game you will have to clone the repository with the following command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/facu2279/Hangman_python
```

then go to the autogenerated folder and run the following command

```
./Hangman.py
```
and ready to play

In case you find a bug, let us know so we can solve it :)

## Messages
There are two ways to win, guess the word, letter by letter or insert the whole word, in both cases the poster that the terminal will display is the following:

<br>
There are also two ways to lose, that you run out of attempts when inserting letter by letter, or that when you inserted the whole word, it was incorrect, in both cases the poster that the terminal will display is the following:

The game expects you to enter a letter or the correct word, in case of entering an invalid character or a word of greater length, the message that the terminal will display will be this:
